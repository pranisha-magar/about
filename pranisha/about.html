    <p>>One Piece Luffy Flag depicts a classic Jolly Roger with a skull and crossbones on a black background, but
        with the distinction of having a Straw Hat referring to Luffy. Indeed, Luffy is the captain and founder
        of the Straw Hat crew, which he leads first on the Vogue Merry ship and then on the Thousand Sunny.
        Alongside Roronoa Zoro, Luffy dreams of becoming the Pirate King by finding the legendary One Piece
        treasure hidden by Gol D.Roger. Being the Lord of the Pirates would give him unparalleled freedom in the
        world. A Jolly Roger, also known as a Skull Mark (ドクロのマーク, Dokuro no Māku?, often shortened to simply
        Mark or Skull) or a Symbol (印シンボル, Shinboru?), is the primary emblem of a pirate crew. It exists in
        countless variations across the world, distinguishing hundreds—if not thousands—of different crews as
        well as their respective property, ships, and territories.</p>
