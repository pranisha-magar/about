            <h3>I AM MONKEY D. LUFFY.</h3>
            <p>
                Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat" Luffy, is a fictional character and the protagonist of the
                One Piece manga series, created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires the
                properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the Devil Fruits that belonged to “Red Hair”
                Shanks.Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate since
                childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail
                from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol
                D. Roger as "King of the Pirates".

            <h4>LUFFY STRAW FLAG</h4>
            <p>One Piece Luffy Flag depicts a classic Jolly Roger with a skull and crossbones on a black background, but
                with the distinction of having a Straw Hat referring to Luffy. Indeed, Luffy is the captain and founder
                of the Straw Hat crew, which he leads first on the Vogue Merry ship and then on the Thousand Sunny.
                Alongside Roronoa Zoro, Luffy dreams of becoming the Pirate King by finding the legendary One Piece
                treasure hidden by Gol D.Roger. Being the Lord of the Pirates would give him unparalleled freedom in the
                world. A Jolly Roger, also known as a Skull Mark (ドクロのマーク, Dokuro no Māku?, often shortened to simply
                Mark or Skull) or a Symbol (印シンボル, Shinboru?), is the primary emblem of a pirate crew. It exists in
                countless variations across the world, distinguishing hundreds—if not thousands—of different crews as
                well as their respective property, ships, and territories.
